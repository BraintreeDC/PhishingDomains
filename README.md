# Phishing Domains Threat List

Domains used in phishing and/or malicious attempts against Braintree District Council. This is provided as a single text file that can be used to block the domains through a DNS resolver (e.g. Pi-hole, pf-BlockerNG etc) or a web filter (e.g. Squid Proxy). The domains could also be used as an IoC (Indicator of Compromise) detector for your network to alert you of potential campaigns being accessed on your network.

 >This list is non-exhaustive and is provided without a warranty/support from Braintree District Council (as set out in the MIT License).

**We strongly recommend verifying domains on this list prior to using them in any security solutions and ensure that any critical services your network relies on are added to an exception/allow list prior to using this list.**
